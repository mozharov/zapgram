help = <b>‚ÑπÔ∏è Bitcoin</b>
    Bitcoin is the best form of money in our history that lives on the Internet. A decentralized and permissionless system with no rulers or controlling authorities. Bitcoin is sound money that is faster, more secure, and more accessible than fiat currencies we are coerced into using today.  
    
    Bitcoin is the first finitely scarce resource in human history: there will never be more than 21 million bitcoin.  
    The smallest unit of Bitcoin is satoshi (sat). 1 bitcoin = 100,000,000 sats.

    If you want to learn more about Bitcoin, I recommend starting with this article:

    <b>‚ÑπÔ∏è Lightning Network</b>
    The Lightning Network is a payment protocol that enables extremely fast and cheap bitcoin payments. It is open, borderless and efficient. It is available to 650+ million people in the world. It allows you to permissionlessly send and receive nearly instant and nearly free payments anywhere in the world.

    <b>‚ö°Ô∏è Connecting an external wallet</b>
    Connect your Lightning wallet to {bot-name} via Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC) so that you can make payments directly from the connected wallet.

    <b>Note:</b> To ensure stable operation of an NWC-connected wallet, it must remain online at all times.  
    If the connected wallet is unavailable during a payment, the transaction will fail. Use {bot-name} Wallet if keeping the connected wallet online is inconvenient for you.

    <i>Use /help to learn more.</i>
    .groups = <b>üë• Groups and channels</b>
        You can add @{bot-username} to a group chat to enable tips in the chat using the /tip command.

        <b>Examples of Uses:</b>
        ‚Ä¢ <code>/tip</code> ‚Äî send 21 sats to the chat owner
        ‚Ä¢ <code>/tip 100</code> ‚Äî send 100 sats to the chat owner
        ‚Ä¢ (reply to message) <code>/tip</code> ‚Äî send 21 sats to the author of the message
        ‚Ä¢ (reply to message) <code>/tip 1000</code> ‚Äî send 1000 sats to the author of the message
        ‚Ä¢ <code>/tip @user</code> ‚Äî send 21 sats to the selected user
        ‚Ä¢ <code>/tip 50 @user</code> ‚Äî send 50 sats to the selected user

        <b>Advanced Features</b>
        If you make {bot-name} an admin of your group, all /tip commands without a specified recipient will be sent to your wallet. {bot-name} will automatically delete all technical messages to keep the chat clean. For the bot to work properly, it only needs the rights to delete messages.
        
        If you make {bot-name} an admin of your channel, all /tip commands in reply to that channel's posts will also be sent to your wallet.
